Hi!
Thanks for downloading my node. Hope it proves useful!
I recommend using the .sbsar file, though I've included the source .sbs in case you'd like to find out how I've made it.
If you're using SD5 instead of 2017, I've included an older version of the node.
My website can be found at www.3dbruno.com and I can be contacted at mail@3dbruno.com.
I'd love to hear any thoughts you might have on this, and please let me know if you run into any problems.
Thanks!
Bruno

-The SBSAR for older substance painter versions includes a manual switch for switching between Direct X 
and OpenGL normalmap formats. 
-Newer versions of substance painter will properly switch between formats
by using: Edit - Project configuration - Normal Map Format
-Older versions of substance painter have this same switch, but it may not work 
for causing the output of this tool to switch formats.
